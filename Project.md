# Chatbot with Bedrock and RAG:
	1.	Basic chatbot UI (Streamlit or simple web app).
	2.	Static knowledge base (AWS cost best practices).
	3.	Deploy infra using Terraform (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB).
	4.	Automate CI/CD with Jenkins (Terraform + code deployment).

## Current State:
	1.	Infrastructure (IAC with Terraform):
	•	You have Terraform set up locally and a Jenkins CICD pipeline running.
	•	We’ve created the following resources:
	•	Lambda Function: The code for your chatbot.
	•	API Gateway: Exposes the Lambda as a REST API.
	•	DynamoDB (optional depending on previous steps): Potential storage for chat logs or knowledge base (if you decide to store the knowledge base there).
	•	Outputs.tf: You’ve correctly set up output variables for easy access to key resources (like the API Gateway invoke URL).
	2.	Next Steps - Adding RAG with AWS Bedrock:
	•	Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG): Integrate AWS Bedrock to augment the responses of the chatbot.
	•	Knowledge Base: Start with static data like AWS cost best practices and whitepapers.
	•	Bedrock Integration: Use Bedrock for retrieval and generation of responses based on user queries.
	3.	Frontend - Streamlit App:
	•	We want to build a simple Streamlit UI that allows users to interact with the chatbot.
	•	The frontend will make API calls to the API Gateway which triggers the Lambda function for processing.
	4.	Future Enhancements:
	•	Real-Time Pricing: Later, integrate AWS Pricing API to fetch real-time data for more dynamic cost-related information.
	•	FinOps Insights: Once the basics are functional, expand the system to provide financial operations insights.


##  Action Plan:
	1.	Step 1 - Static Knowledge Base:
	•	Create a file (e.g., knowledge_base.json or knowledge_base.txt) with AWS cost best practices or whitepapers for the initial static data.
	•	This will serve as the knowledge that Bedrock will use for retrieval when a user asks about AWS costs or best practices.
	2.	Step 2 - AWS Bedrock Integration:
	•	Integrate AWS Bedrock to use this knowledge base for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
	•	You’ll need to configure the Bedrock model to pull relevant information from your knowledge base based on user queries.
	3.	Step 3 - Lambda Function Update:
	•	Update the Lambda function to interact with Bedrock, pass the user’s query, and return a response using Bedrock’s RAG capabilities.
	4.	Step 4 - Streamlit Frontend:
	•	Set up a Streamlit app that allows users to ask questions, interact with the API Gateway, and view responses generated by the Lambda function.
	5.	Step 5 - CI/CD Automation:
	•	Continue refining your Jenkins pipeline to automate deployments and updates as we build and test each part.

## Corrected Roadmap:

1. Start with a Static Knowledge Base
	•	Static Data: AWS cost best practices, whitepapers, and other relevant content (for now, no real-time pricing).
	•	Data Storage: We’ll store this data in a simple DynamoDB table or S3 bucket (for easy access and management).
	•	Lambda: Integrate the Lambda to fetch and serve this static knowledge base data to the user.

2. Build Basic Chatbot UI (Streamlit)
	•	Frontend Interface: Use Streamlit to allow users to interact with the chatbot.
	•	API Gateway: API Gateway will handle user input and route it to the Lambda function.

3. Define RAG Status Logic
	•	RAG Status: Based on the static knowledge (e.g., AWS best practices), we can assign RAG statuses to various cost-related items:
	•	Red: High risk or poor AWS cost management practices.
	•	Amber: Caution, something to improve.
	•	Green: Good practice.
	•	We’ll integrate simple logic to evaluate responses based on these statuses.

4. Deploy Infrastructure Using Terraform (IAC)
	•	We’ll continue using Terraform to deploy and manage all resources (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, etc.).
	•	Lambda Execution: Lambda will process the incoming queries and return RAG-based responses.

5. CI/CD Automation with Jenkins
	•	Terraform in Jenkins: Automate the deployment and updates of Terraform-managed infrastructure using Jenkins pipelines.
	•	Code Deployment: Ensure that code changes (e.g., Lambda updates) are seamlessly deployed using Jenkins.

6. Expand to Real-Time Pricing and FinOps Insights
	•	Once the static version is working, we’ll integrate AWS Pricing API to fetch real-time data and improve cost optimization insights.
	•	We’ll later extend this with FinOps concepts once the basics are solid.

## Next Steps:

Let’s focus on the first steps of the plan:
	1.	Create the Static Knowledge Base (with RAG status logic) and deploy it via Lambda and DynamoDB.
	2.	Create a simple Streamlit interface to interact with the chatbot and send queries.
